# Explanation

This program has the same code as ['msocket.c'](https://github.com/Nitczi/socket_connections/blob/main/msocket.c), but with an implemented 'for' loop. This program takes a single argument and, with the port range specified in the code, iterates through the ports to determine if they are open or not..
